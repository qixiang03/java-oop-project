# java-oop-project

it is a final asseessment for my java oop module.
this project is about initiatives to bring awareness to environment,
so this is how we ideated and programmed a software to provide a one dollar one tree donation initiative
with every dollar donated to our programme (unattainable), we would plant a tree thanks to their donation.
furthermore, we will on timely monitor the tree and update the status of it by capturing a picture of it 
every once in a while and uplaod it to the system.
each user will be allocated a user id and when they type in the user id, they will be able to retreive 
the latest photo of their tree.
