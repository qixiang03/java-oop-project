# java oop

it was my first object oriented programming module in java.
this project was a final group assessment about one dollar incentive propgramme.
with one dollar donated, we will "theoretically plant" a tree and we would assign a tree id to the tree.
the programme allow users to choose where the plant to be planted, as a customisation and the customisation allows
trees to be planted worldwide.
user may use the tree id to trace the monitor the tree with photo the farmer uploaded.
tree id further allows user to comment on their experience on this programme, they can rate from 1-5 and leave a comment.

from the admin side,
admin can update the tree photo in order the user always have the latest status of the tree.
the comments received will be stored into the system and admin may review them all in a window.

it was to raise awareness of SDG 13 (Climate Action) and to encourage user to take action in saving the earth with just a
small amount.
